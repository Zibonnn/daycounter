# Day Counter
Day Counter is an easy-to-use Chrome Extension that allows you to create multiple day counters that show up on each New Tab page or when manually accessed through the extension icon. Easily track days until Birthdays, Holidays, or any other events. You can also track days since a previous event, such as starting at a new job. Events can also be given names and be edited/deleted at any point. This was created as a simple exercise to get used to the functionality and development of Chrome extensions.
